Read, code, debug & test mode: no interactive messages or talking required. Quietly complete task.
---
READ all of `{{TASK_FILE}}`. Pick ONE task to do, verify in git history. Verify via grep/glob search in codebase or web/code search. ONLY do one task. This may include other implicit changes not strictly documented; this is fine. Complete task, verify via {{VERIFY_COMMANDS}}. Update/tick off in the task file. Commit changes, including the doc update. If you learn a new, undocumented critical operational detail (e.g. how to build, test, unintuitive designs, issues, blockers, etc.), update or add to the `# DEV NOTES` section in AGENTS.md. NEVER GIT PUSH. ONLY COMMIT.
